/**
 *  @class      dash::mpd::ISubRepresentation
 *  @brief      This interface is needed for accessing the attributes and elements of the <tt><b>SubRepresentation</b></tt> element as specified in <em>ISO/IEC 23009-1, Part 1, 2012</em>, section 5.3.6.2, table 8
 *  @details    Sub-Representations are embedded in regular Representations and are described by the <tt><b>SubRepresentation</b></tt> element. 
 *              <tt><b>SubRepresentation</b></tt> elements are contained in a <tt><b>Representation</b></tt> element.\n
 *              The SubRepresentation element describes properties of one or several media content components that are embedded in the Representation.
 *              It may for example describe the exact properties of an embedded audio component (e.g., codec, sampling rate, etc.),
 *              an embedded sub-title (e.g., codec) or it may describe some embedded lower quality video layer (e.g. some lower frame rate, etc.).
