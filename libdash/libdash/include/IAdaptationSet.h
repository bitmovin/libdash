/**
 *  @class      dash::mpd::IAdaptationSet
 *  @brief      This interface is needed for accessing the attributes and elements of the <b><tt>AdaptationSet</tt></b> element 
 *              as specified in <em>ISO/IEC 23009-1, Part 1, 2012</em>, section 5.3.3.2, table 5
 *  @details    Each Period consists of one or more Adaptation Sets. An Adaptation Set is described by an <b><tt>AdaptationSet</tt></b> element. 
 *              <b><tt>AdaptationSet</tt></b> elements are contained in a <b><tt>Period</tt></b> element.\n\n
 *              An Adaptation Set contains alternate Representations, i.e. only one Representation within an Adaptation Set is expected to be presented at a time.
 *              All Representations contained in one Adaptation Set represent the same media content components and therefore contain media streams that are considered to be perceptually equivalent.\n\n
 *              Representations are arranged into Adaptation Sets according to the media content component properties of the media content components present in the Representations, namely
 *              <ul>
 *                  <li>the language as described by the \c \@lang attribute,
 *                  <li>the media component type described by the \c \@contentType attribute,
 *                  <li>the picture aspect ratio as described by the \c \@par attribute,
 *                  <li>the role property as described by the <b><tt>Role</tt></b> elements,
 *                  <li>the accessibility property as described by the <b><tt>Accessibility</tt></b> elements,
 *                  <li>the viewpoint property as described by the <b><tt>Viewpoint</tt></b> elements,
 *                  <li>the rating property as described by the <b><tt>Rating</tt></b> elements.
 *              </ul>
 *              Representations shall appear in the same Adaptation Set if and only if they have identical values for all of these media content component properties for each media content component.\n\n
 *              The values for the elements <b><tt>Role</tt></b>, <b><tt>Accessibility</tt></b>, <b><tt>Viewpoint</tt></b> and <b><tt>Rating</tt></b> are generally not provided 
 *              within the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 23009. However, a number of simple schemes are defined in section 5.8.5. of <em>ISO/IEC 23009-1, Part 1, 2012</em>.\n\n
 *              If there exist multiple media content components then the properties of each media content component shall be described by a separate ContentComponent element as defined in 5.5.4.
 *              The ContentComponent element shares common elements and attributes with the <b><tt>AdaptationSet</tt></b> element. Default values, or values applicable to all media content components, 
 *              may be provided directly in the <b><tt>AdaptationSet</tt></b> element. Attributes present in the <b><tt>AdaptationSet</tt></b> shall not be repeated in the ContentComponent element.\n\n
 *              The <b><tt>AdaptationSet</tt></b> element may contain default values for elements and attributes associated to the contained Representations. 
 *              The list of possible present elements and attributes that are common to <b><tt>AdaptationSet</tt></b> and <b><tt>Representation</tt></b> (and also <b><tt>SubRepresentation</tt></b>)
 *              are collected in 5.3.7. Any of the common attributes shall only be present either in the <b><tt>AdaptationSet</tt></b> element or in the <b><tt>Representation</tt></b> element, 
 *              but not in both.\n\n
 *              The <b><tt>AdaptationSet</tt></b> element also supports the description of ranges for the \c \@bandwidth, \c \@width, \c \@height and \c \@frameRate attributes 
 *              associated to the contained Representations, which provide a summary of all values for all the Representations within this Adaptation Set. 
 *              The Representations contained within an Adaptation Set shall not contain values outside the ranges documented for that Adaptation Set. \n\n
 *              Adaptation Sets may be further arranged into groups using the \c \@group attribute. The semantics of this grouping is that the media content within one Period is represented by: 
 *              <ol>
 *                  <li>either one Representation from group 0, if present,
 *                  <li>or the combination of at most one Representation from each non-zero group.
 *              </ol>
 *              If the <tt><b>AdaptationSet</b>\@group</tt> attribute is not present then all Representations in this Adaptation Set are assigned to a non-zero group specific to this Adaptation Set.
