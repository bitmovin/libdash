/**
 *  @class      dash::mpd::IRepresentation
 *  @brief      This interface is needed for accessing the attributes and elements of the <tt><b>Representation</b></tt> element 
 *              as specified in <em>ISO/IEC 23009-1, Part 1, 2012</em>, section 5.3.5.2, table 7
 *  @details    Representations are described by the <tt><b>Representation</b></tt> element. <tt><b>Representation</b></tt> elements are contained in an <tt><b>AdaptationSet</b></tt> element.\n
 *              A Representation is one of the alternative choices of the complete set or subset of media content components comprising the media content during the defined Period.\n
 *              A Representation starts at the start of the Period \em PeriodStart and continues to the end of the Period, i.e. the start of the next Period or the end of the Media Presentation.\n
 *              Each Representation includes one or more media streams, where each media stream is an encoded version of one media content component.\n
 *              A Representation consists of one or more Segments.\n
 *              Each Representation either shall contain an Initialization Segment or each Media Segment in the Representation shall be self-initializing, 
 *              i.e. the Media Segment itself conforms to the media type as specified in the \c \@mimeType attribute for this Representation. \n
 *              When a Representation is not a dependent Representation, i.e. the \c \@dependencyId attribute is absent, then concatenation of the Initialization Segment, 
 *              if present, and all consecutive Media Segments in one Representation shall represent a conforming Segment sequence as defined in section 4.5.3 of <em>ISO/IEC 23009-1, Part 1, 2012</em>
 *              conforming to the media type as specified in the \c \@mimeType attribute for this Representation.\n
 *              Dependent Representations are described by a <tt><b>Representation</b></tt> element that contains a \c \@dependencyId attribute.
 *              Dependent Representations are regular Representations except that they depend on a set of complementary Representations for decoding and/or presentation. 
 *              The \c \@dependencyId contains the values of the \c \@id attribute of all the complementary Representations, i.e. Representations that are necessary to 
 *              present and/or decode the media content components contained in this dependent Representation.\n
 *              For any dependent Representation X that depends on complementary Representation Y, the <em>m</em>-th Subsegment of X and the <em>n</em>-th Subsegment of Y 
 *              shall be non-overlapping (as defined in 4.5.3) whenever \em m is not equal to \em n. For dependent Representations the concatenation of the Initialization Segment with the 
 *              sequence of Subsegments of the dependent Representations, each being preceded by the corresponding Subsegment of each of the complementary Representations 
 *              in order as provided in the \c \@dependencyId attribute shall represent a conforming Subsegment sequence as defined in 4.5.3 conforming to the media 
 *              format as specified in the \c \@mimeType attribute for this dependent Representation.\n\n
 *              \b NOTE:    When decoding of a dependent Representation is started from a SAP in the (Sub)Segment with number \em i, the decoding process does not need to access 
 *                          data from the complementary Representation(s) from any earlier (sub)segments than (sub)Segment with number i of the complementary Representation(s).
