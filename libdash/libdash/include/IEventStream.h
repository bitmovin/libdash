/**
 *  @class      dash::mpd::IEventStream
 *  @brief      This interface is needed for accessing the common elements and attributes of <tt><b>EventStream</b></tt>
 *              as specified in <em>ISO/IEC 23009-1</em>, subclause 5.10.2.2, Table 34
 *  @details    The EventStream element is structured in a similar way as the descriptor defined in subclause 5.8, namely it contains a \c @schemeIdUri attribute 
 *              that provides a URI to identify the scheme and an optional attribute \c @value. The semantics of the element are specific to the scheme employed. The URI identifying the scheme may be a URN or a URL. \n
 *              A Period shall contain at most one \b EventStream element with the same value of the \c @schemeIdUri attribute and the value of the \c @value attribute, i.e. all Events of one type shall be clustered in one Event Stream. \n
 *              As Event Streams contain timed events, also a time scale attribute \c @timescale is provided to assign events to a specific media presentation time within the Period. The timed events themselves are described by the \b Event element.
 *              Ã¬The XML syntax of the Event Stream is provided in subclause 5.10.2.3.
 *  @see        dash::mpd::IEvent dash::mpd::IMPDElement
